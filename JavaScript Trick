1.  js foreach Array Iteration: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_array_iteration.asp
2.  Array is an object
3.  Avoid String, Number, and Boolean objects. They complicate your code and slow down execution speed.
4.  A safer way to break up a string, is to use string addition:document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello " +
  "Dolly!";
5. 
    var x = "John";             
    var y = new String("John");
    // (x === y) is false because x and y have different types (string and object)
    /*--AND---*/
    var x = new String("John");             
    var y = new String("John");

    // (x === y) is false because x and y are different objects
6.
  slice()
    If a parameter is negative, the position is counted from the end of the string.
  substring()
    is similar to slice().
    The difference is that substring() cannot accept negative indexes.
  substr()
    is similar to slice().
    The difference is that the second parameter specifies the length of the extracted part.
7.replace()
  To replace case insensitive, use a regular expression with an /i flag (insensitive)
  To replace all matches, use a regular expression with a /g flag (global match);
8.
  let a = 0.1 + 02; // result 0.30000000000000004
  let x = (0.1 * 10 + 0.2 * 10) / 10;//result 0.3
9. JavaScript will try to convert strings to numbers in all numeric operations, but for additional, it's not work. Ex: "10" + "20" = "1020";
10. Never write a number with a leading zero (like 07).Some JavaScript versions interpret numbers as octal if they are written with a leading zero.
